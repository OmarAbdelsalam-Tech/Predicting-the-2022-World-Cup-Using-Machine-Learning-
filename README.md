# Predicting-the-2022-World-Cup-Using-Machine-Learning-
In this project, we use machine learning to predict the results of the 2022 World Cup. We first collect data on all the teams that have participated in the World Cup since its inception. This data includes information on the teams' performances in previous World Cups, as well as their recent form leading up to the current tournament. We then use this data to train a machine learning model that can predict the results of future World Cups.
The machine learning model we use is a Logistic Regression model. In this project, we use Logistic Regression to predict the winner of each World Cup match. To do this, we first need to train the model with data from previous World Cups. For each match in the training data, we use the teams' previous World Cup performance, as well as their recent form, to predict the winner. The model then uses this information to learn how to predict the results of future matches.
We then use the trained model to predict the results of the 2022 World Cup.
